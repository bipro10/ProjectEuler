# ProjectEuler Solutions

This package contains my solutions to the problems in [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/)
and an [contest in HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges) based on this Problems.

The solutions are mostly programmed with C++, some may be Java.
